Abstract

   This document defines the Information Elements that are necessary for
   the transportation of endpoint information between Secure Automation
   and Continuous Monitoring (SACM) components, as well as tasks carried
   out on the endpoint information by SACM components.  The primary
   purpose of the SACM Information Model is to ensure the interoperable
   exchange of security posture information by defining the structure
   and metadata used to exchange the posture information represented by
   platform and/or vendor specific collection data models.  The
   Information Elements and corresponding types are maintained as the
   IANA "SACM Information Elements" registry.

1.  Introduction

   The SACM Information Model (IM) serves multiple purposes:

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   o  to ensure interoperable exchange of security posture information
      which is represented by different data models,

   o  to provide a standardized set of Information Elements - the SACM
      Vocabulary - to enable the exchange of content vital to automated
      security posture assessment, and

   o  to enable secure information sharing in a scalable and extensible
      fashion in order to support the tasks conducted by SACM
      components.

   A complete set of requirements imposed on the IM can be found in
   [I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements].  The SACM IM is intended to support a
   standardized data exchange mechanism between SACM components (data in
   motion).

   The information model expresses, for example, target endpoint (TE)
   attributes, guidance, and evaluation results metadata describing the
   collected posture data.  The corresponding Information Elements are
   consumed and produced by SACM components as they carry out tasks.

   The primary tasks that this information model supports (on data,
   control, and management plane) are:

   o  TE Discovery

   o  TE Characterization

   o  TE Classification

   o  Collection

   o  Evaluation

   o  Information Sharing

   o  SACM Component Discovery

   o  SACM Component Authentication

   o  SACM Component Authorization

   o  SACM Component Registration

   These tasks are defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology].

2.  Conventions Used In This Document

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Information Element Examples

   The notation used to define the SACM Information Elements (IEs) is
   based on a customized version of the IPFIX information model syntax.
   It should be noted that while examples may include actual names of
   information elements, they are not intended to influence how
   corresponding SACM IEs should be defined.  The examples are provided
   for demonstration purposes only.

3.  Information Elements Overview

   The IEs defined in this document comprise the building blocks by
   which all SACM content is composed.  They are consumed and provided
   by SACM components on the data plane.  Every Information Element has
   a unique label: its name.  Every IE defined by the SACM IM is
   registered as a type at the IANA registry.  The Integer Index of the
   IANA SMI number tables can be used by SACM data models.

3.1.  Information Element Naming Convention

   SACM Information Elements must adhere to the following naming
   conventions.

   o  Names SHOULD be descriptive

   o  Names MUST be unique within the SACM registry.  Enterprise-
      specific names SHOULD be prefixed with a Private Enterprise Number
      [PEN].

   o  Names MUST start with lowercase letters unless it begins with a
      Private Enterprise Number

   o  Composed names MUST use capital letters for the first letter of
      each part

3.2.  Extensibility of Information Elements

   A SACM data model based on this information model MAY include
   additional information elements that are not defined here.  The
   labels of additional Information Elements included in different SACM



Waltermire, et al.        Expires March 5, 2017                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   data models MUST NOT conflict with the labels of the Information
   Elements defined by this information model, and the names of
   additional Information Elements MUST NOT conflict with each other or
   across multiple data models.  In order to avoid naming conflicts, the
   labels of additional IEs SHOULD be prefixed to avoid collisions
   across extensions.  The prefix MUST include an organizational
   identifier and therefore, for example, MAY be an IANA enterprise
   number, a (partial) name space URI, or an organization name
   abbreviation.

3.3.  Structure of Information Elements

   There are two basic types of IEs:

   o  Attributes: are "atomic" information elements with a unique name
      and a simple value.  Attributes can be components of Subjects.

   o  Subjects: are composite information elements with a unique name
      and are composed of attributes and/or other subjects.  Every IE
      that is part of a subject can have a quantity associated with it
      (0..1, 0..*, etc.).  The contents of a subject can be ordered or
      unordered.

   Subjects can be nested and the SACM IM allows for circular or
   recursive nesting.  The association of IEs via nesting results in a
   tree-like structure wherein subjects compose the root and
   intermediary nodes and attributes the leaves of the tree.  This
   semantic structure does not impose a specific structure on SACM data
   models regarding data in motion or data repository schemata for data
   at rest.

3.4.  Notation of Information Elements

   The notation of the SACM IM is defined below and is based on a
   modified version of the IP Information Flow Export (IPFIX)
   Information Model syntax described in Section 2.1 of [RFC7012].  The
   customized syntax used by the SACM IM is defined below in Figure 1.

       elementId (required):    The numeric identifier of the
                                Information Element. It is used
                                for the compact identification
                                of an Information Element. If
                                this identifier is used without
                                an enterpriseID, then the
                                elementId must be unique, and
                                the description of allowed values
                                is administrated by IANA. The
                                value "TBD" may be used during

                                development of the information
                                model until an elementId is
                                assigned by IANA and filled
                                in at publication time.

       enterpriseId (optional): Enterprises may wish to define
                                Information Elements without
                                registering them with IANA, for
                                example, for enterprise-internal
                                purposes.  For such Information
                                Elements, the elementId is
                                not sufficient when used
                                outside the enterprise. If
                                specifications of enterprise-
                                specific Information Elements
                                are made public and/or if
                                enterprise-specific identifiers
                                are used by SACM components
                                outside the enterprise, then the
                                enterprise-specific identifier
                                MUST be made globally unique by
                                combining it with an enterprise
                                identifier.  Valid values for the
                                enterpriseId are defined by IANA
                                as Structure of Management
                                Information (SMI) network management
                                private enterprise numbers.

       name (required):         A unique and meaningful name for
                                the Information Element.

       dataType (required):     There are two kinds of datatypes:
                                simple and structured. Attributes are
                                defined using simple datatypes
                                and subjects are defined using
                                structured datatypes. The contents of
                                the datatype field will be either
                                a reference to one of the simple
                                datatypes listed in Section
                                5.1, or the specification of
                                structured datatype as defined in
                                Section 5.2.

       status (required):       The status of the specification
                                of the Information Element.
                                Allowed values are "current" and
                                "deprecated". All newly defined
                                Information Elements have "current"

                                status. The process for moving
                                Information Elements to the
                                "deprecated" status is TBD.

       description (required): Describes the meaning of the
                               Information Element, how it is

                               etc.

       structure (optional):   A parsable property that provides
                               details about the definition of
                               structured Information Elements as
                               described in Section 5.2.

       references (optional):  Identifies other RFCs or documents
                               outside the IETF which provide
                               additional information or context
                               about the Information Element.

3.5.  Categories

   Categories are special IEs which represent a choice among multiple
   IEs via just one name.  A prominent example of a category is network-
   address.  Network- address is a category that every kind of network
   address is associated with, e.g. mac-address, ipv4-address,
   ipv6-address, or typed-network-address.  If a subject includes
   network-address as one of its components, any of the category members
   are valid to be used in its place.

   Another prominent example is EndpointIdentifier.  Some IEs can be
   used to identify (and over time re-recognize) target endpoints -
   those are associated with the category endpoint-identifier.

4.  Predefined SACM Subjects

   The SACM IM provides two conceptual top-level subjects that are used
   to ensure a homogeneous structure for SACM content and its associated
   metadata: SACM statements and SACM content elements.  Every set of
   IEs that is provided by a SACM component must provide the information
   contained in these two subjects although it is up to the implementer
   whether or not the subjects are explicitly defined in a data model.

   In general, every piece of information that enables security posture
   assessment or further enriches the quality of the assessment process
   can be associated with metadata.  In the SACM IM, metadata is
   represented by special, predefined subjects and is bundled with other



Waltermire, et al.        Expires March 5, 2017                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   attributes or subjects to provide additional information about them.
   The IM explicitly defines two kinds of metadata: sacmMetadata,
   focusing on the data origin (the SACM component that provides the
   information to the SACM domain), and contentMetadata, focusing on the
   data source (the target endpoint that is assessed).

   Metadata can also include relationships that refer to other
   associated IEs (or SACM content in general) by using referencing
   labels that have to be included in the metadata of the associated IE.

   Lastly, event subjects provide a structure to represent the change of
   IE values that was detected by a collection task at a specific point
   of time.

4.1.  SACM Content Elements

   Every piece of information that is provided by a SACM component is
   always associated with a set of metadata, for example, the timestamp
   at which this set of information was produced (e.g. by a collection
   task) or what target endpoint this set of information is about (e.g.
   the data-source or a target endpoint identifier, respectively).  The
   subject that associates content IE with content-metadata IE is called
   a content-element.  Content metadata can also include relationships
   that express associations with other content-elements.

               contentElement = (
                 contentMetadata = (
                   collectionTimestamp = 146193322,
                   dataSource = fb02e551-7101-4e68-8dec-1fde6bd10981
                 ),
                 collectedData
                 )
               )

   Figure 2: Example of collected data associated with a timestamp and a
                          target endpoint label.

4.2.  SACM Statements

   One or more SACM content elements are bundled in a SACM statement.
   In contrast to content-metadata, statement-metadata focuses on the
   providing SACM component instead of the target endpoint that the
   content is about.  The only content-specific metadata included in the
   SACM statement is the content-type IE.  Therefore, multiple content-
   elements that share the same statement metadata and are of the same
   content-type can be included in a single SACM statement.  A SACM
   statement functions similar to an envelope or a header.  Its purpose
   is to enable the tracking of the origin of data inside a SACM domain



Waltermire, et al.        Expires March 5, 2017                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   and more importantly to enable the mitigation of conflicting
   information that may originate from different SACM components.  How a
   consuming SACM component actually deals with conflicting information
   is out-of-scope of the SACM IM.  Semantically, the term statement
   implies that the SACM content provided by a SACM component might not
   be correct in every context, but rather is the result of a best-
   effort to produce correct information.

               sacmStatement = (
                 statementMetadata = (
                   publishTimestamp = 1461934031,
                   dataOrigin = 24e67957-3d31-4878-8892-da2b35e121c2,
                   content-type = observation
                 ),
                 contentElement = (
                   contentMetadata = (
                     collectionTimestamp = 146193322,
                     dataSource = fb02e551-7101-4e68-8dec-1fde6bd10981
                   ),
                   collectedData
                 )
                 contentElement = (
                   contentMetadata = (
                     collectionTimestamp = 146193324,

                   ),
                   collectedData
                 )
               )

      Figure 3: Example of a simple SACM statement including content
                                 elements.

4.3.  Relationships

   An IE can be associated with another IE, e.g. a user-name attribute
   can be associated with a content-authorization subject.  These
   references are expressed via the relationships subject, which can be
   included in a corresponding content-metadata subject.  The
   relationships subject includes a list of one or more references.  The
   SACM IM does not enforce a SACM domain to use unique identifiers as
   references.  Therefore, there are at least two ways to reference
   another

   o  The value of a reference represents a specific content-label that
      is unique in a SACM domain (and has to be included in the
      corresponding content-element metadata in order to be referenced),
      or



Waltermire, et al.        Expires March 5, 2017                [Page 12]

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   o  The reference is a subject that includes an appropriate number of
      IEs in order to identify the referenced content-element by its
      actual content.

   It is recommended to provide unique identifiers in a SACM domain and
   the SACM IM provides a corresponding naming-convention as a reference
   in Section 3.1.  The alternative highlighted above summarizes a valid
   approach that does not require unique identifiers and is similar to
   the approach of referencing target endpoints via identifying
   attributes included in a characterization record.

               contentElement = (
                 contentMetadata = (
                   collectionTimestamp = 1461934031,
                   teLabel =
                   fb02e551-7101-4e68-8dec-1fde6bd10981
                   relationships = (

                   )
                 ),

               )

    Figure 4: Example instance of a content-element subject associated
              with another subject via its content metadata.

4.4.  Event

   Event subjects provide a structure to represent the change of IE
   values that was detected by a collection task at a specific point of
   time.  It is mandatory to include the new values and the collection
   timestamp in an event subject and it is recommended to include the
   past values and a collection timestamp that were replaced by the new
   IE values.  Every event can also be associated with a subject-
   specific event-timestamp and a lastseen-timestamp that might differ
   from the corresponding collection-timestamps.  If these are omitted
   the collection-timestamp that is included in the content-metadata
   subject is used instead.

5.  Abstract Data Types

   This section describes the set of valid abstract data types that can
   be used for the specification of the SACM Information Elements in
   Section 7.  SACM currently supports two classes of datatypes that can
   be used to define Information Elements.

   o  Simple: Datatypes that are atomic and are used to define the type
      of data represented by an attribute Information Element.

   o  Structured: Datatypes that can be used to define the type of data
      represented by a subject Information Element.

   Note that further abstract data types may be specified by future
   extensions of the SACM information model.

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


5.1.  Simple Datatypes

5.1.1.  IPFIX Datatypes

   To facilitate the use of existing work, SACM supports the following
   abstract data types defined in Section 3 of [RFC7012].

   o  unsigned8, unsigned16, unsigned32, unsigned64

   o  signed8, signed16, signed32, signed64

   o  float32, float64

   o  boolean

   o  macAddress

   o  octetArray

   o  string

   o  dateTimeSeconds, dateTimeMilliseconds, dateTimeMicroseconds,
      dateTimeNanoSeconds

   o  ipv4Address, ipv6Address

5.2.  Structured Datatypes

5.2.1.  List Datatypes

   SACM defines the following abstract list data types that are used to
   represent the structured data associated with subjects.

   o  list: indicates that the Information Element order is not
      significant but MAY be preserved.

   o  orderedList: indicates that Information Element order is
      significant and MUST be preserved.

   The notation for defining a SACM structured datatype is based on
   regular expressions, which are composed of the keywords "list" or
   "orderedList" and an Information Element expression.  IE expressions
   use some of the regular expression syntax and operators, but the
   terms in the expression are the names of defined Information Elements
   instead of character classes.  The syntax for defining list and
   orderedList datatypes is described below, using BNF:

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


       <list-def> -> ("list"|"orderedList") "(" <ie-expression> ")"

       <ie-expression> -> <ie-name> <cardinality>?
                          ( ("," | "|") <ie-name> <cardinality>?)*

       <cardinality> -> "*" | "+" | "?" |
                        ( "(" <non-neg-int> ("," <non-neg-int>)? ")" )

               Figure 6: Syntax for Defining List Datatypes

   As seen above, multiple occurences of an Information Element may be
   present in a structured datatype.  The cardinality of an Information
   Element within a structured Information Element definition is defined
   by the following operators:

       * - zero or more occurrences

       + - one or more occurrences

       ? - zero or one occurrence

      (m,n) - between m and n occurrences

         Figure 7: Specifying Cardinality for Structured Datatypes

   The absence of a cardinality operator implies one mandatory
   occurrence of the Information Element.

   Below is an example of a structured Information Element definition.

   personInfo = list(firstName, middleNames?, lastName)
   firstName = string
   middleNames = orderedList(middleName+)
   middleName = string
   lastName = string

   As an example, consider the name "John Ronald Reuel Tolkien".
   Below are instances of this name, structured according to the
   personInfo definition.

   personInfo = (firstName="John", middleNames(middleName="Ronald",
                 middleName="Reuel"), lastName="Tolkien")

   personInfo = (middleNames(middleName="Ronald", middleName=" Reuel"),
                 lastName="Tolkien", firstName="John")

   The instance below is not legal with respect to the definition
   of personInfo because the order in middleNames is not preserved.

   personInfo = (firstName="John", middleNames(middleName=" Reuel",
                 middleName="Ronald"), lastName="Tolkien")

         Figure 8: Example of Defining a Structured List Datatype

5.2.2.  Enumeration Datatype

   SACM defines the following abstract enumeration datatype that is used
   to represent the restriction of an attribute value to a set of
   values.

   name, hex-value, description
   <enumeration-def> -> -> <name> ";" <hex-value> ";" <description>
   <name> -> [0-9a-zA-Z]+
   <hex-value> -> 0x[0-9a-fA-F]+
   <description> -> [0-9a-zA-Z\.\,]+

           Figure 9: Syntax for Defining an Enumeration Datatype

   Below is an example of a structured Information Element definition
   for an enumeration.

                               Red    ; 0x1  ; The color is red.
                               Orange ; 0x2  ; The color is orange.
                               Yellow ; 0x3  ; The color is yellow.
                               Green  ; 0x4  ; The color is green.
                               ...

6.  Information Model Assets

   In order to represent the Information Elements related to the areas
   listed in , the information model defines the information needs (or
   metadata about those information needs) related to following types of
   assets which are defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology] (and included
   below for convenience) which are of interest to SACM.  Specifically:

   o  Endpoint

   o  Software Component

   o  Hardware Component

   o  Identity

   o  Guidance

   o  Evaluation Results

   The following figure shows the make up of an Endpoint asset which
   contains zero or more hardware components and zero or more software
   components each of which may have zero or more instances running an
   endpoint at any given time as well as zero or more identities that
   act on behalf of the endpoint when interfacing with other endpoints,
   tools, or services.  An endpoint may also contain other endpoints in
   the case of a virtualized environment.

                      Figure 11: Model of an Endpoint

6.1.  Asset

   As defined in [RFC4949], an asset is a system resource that is (a)
   required to be protected by an information system's security policy,
   (b) intended to be protected by a countermeasure, or (c) required for
   a system's mission.

   In the scope of SACM, an asset can be composed of other assets.
   Examples of Assets include: Endpoints, Software, Guidance, or
   Identity.  Furthermore, an asset is not necessarily owned by an
   organization.

6.2.  Endpoint

   From [RFC5209], an endpoint is any computing device that can be
   connected to a network.  Such devices normally are associated with a
   particular link layer address before joining the network and
   potentially an IP address once on the network.  This includes:
   laptops, desktops, servers, cell phones, or any device that may have
   an IP address.

   To further clarify, an endpoint is any physical or virtual device
   that may have a network address.  Note that, network infrastructure

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   devices (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls), which fit the
   definition, are also considered to be endpoints within this document.

   Physical endpoints are always composites that are composed of
   hardware components and software components.  Virtual endpoints are
   composed entirely of software components and rely on software
   components that provide functions equivalent to hardware components.

   The SACM architecture differentiates two essential categories of
   endpoints: Endpoints whose security posture is intended to be
   assessed (target endpoints) and endpoints that are specifically
   excluded from endpoint posture assessment (excluded endpoints).

6.3.  Hardware Component

   Hardware components are the distinguishable physical components that
   compose an endpoint.  The composition of an endpoint can be changed
   over time by adding or removing hardware components.  In essence,
   every physical endpoint is potentially a composite of multiple
   hardware components, typically resulting in a hierarchical
   composition of hardware components.  The composition of hardware
   components is based on interconnects provided by specific hardware
   types (e.g.  mainboard is a hardware type that provides local busses
   as an interconnect).  In general, a hardware component can be
   distinguished by its serial number.

   Examples of a hardware components include: motherboards, network
   interfaces, graphics cards, hard drives, etc.

6.4.  Software Component

   A software package installed on an endpoint (including the operating
   system) as well as a unique serial number if present (e.g. a text
   editor associated with a unique license key).

   It should be noted that this includes both benign and harmful
   software packages.  Examples of benign software components include:
   applications, patches, operating system kernel, boot loader,
   firmware, code embedded on a webpage, etc.  Examples of malicious
   software components include: malware, trojans, viruses, etc.

6.4.1.  Software Instance

   A running instance of the software component (e.g. on a multi-user
   system, one logged-in user has one instance of a text editor running
   and another logged-in user has another instance of the same text
   editor running, or on a single-user system, a user could have
   multiple independent instances of the same text editor running).

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


6.5.  Identity

   Any mechanism that can be used to identify an asset during an
   authentication process.  Examples include usernames, user and device
   certificates, etc.  Note, that this is different than the identity of
   assets in the context of designation as described in Section 11.1.

6.6.  Guidance

   Guidance is input instructions to processes and tasks, such as
   collection or evaluation.  Guidance influences the behavior of a SACM
   component and is considered content of the management plane.
   Guidance can be manually or automatically generated or provided.
   Typically, the tasks that provide guidance to SACM components have a
   low-frequency and tend to be sporadic.  A prominent example of
   guidance are target endpoint profiles,but guidance can have many
   forms, including:

      Configuration, e.g. a SACM component's name, or a CMDB's IPv6
      address.

      Profiles, e.g. a set of expected states for network behavior
      associated with target endpoints employed by specific users.

      Policies, e.g. an interval to refresh the registration of a SACM
      component, or a list of required capabilities for SACM components
      in a specific location.

6.6.1.  Collection Guidance

   A collector may need guidance to govern what it collects and when.
   Collection Guidance provides instructions for a Collector that
   specifies which endpoint attributes to collect, when to collect them,
   and how to collect them.  Collection Guidance is composed of Target
   Endpoint Attribute Guidance, Frequency Guidance, and Method Guidance.

   o  Target Endpoint Attribute Guidance: Set of endpoint attributes
      that are supposed to be collected from a target endpoint.  The
      definition of the set of endpoint attributes is typically based on
      an endpoint characterization record.

   o  Frequency Guidance: Specifies when endpoint attributes are to be
      collected.

   o  Method Guidance: Indicates how endpoint attributes are to be
      collected.

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


6.6.2.  Evaluation Guidance

   An evaluator typically needs guidance to govern what it considers to
   be a good or bad security posture.  Evaluation Guidance provides
   instructions for an Evaluator that specifies which endpoint
   attributes to evaluate, the desired state of those endpoint
   attributes, and any special requirements that enable an Evaluator to
   determine if the endpoint attributes can be used in the evaluation
   (e.g. freshness of data, how it was collected, etc.).  Evaluation
   Guidance is composed of Target Endpoint Attribute Guidance, Expected
   Endpoint Attribute Value Guidance, and Frequency Guidance.

   o  Target Endpoint Attribute Guidance: Set of target endpoint
      attributes that are supposed to be used in an evaluation as well
      as any requirements on the endpoint attributes.  The definition of
      the set of endpoint attributes is typically based on an endpoint
      characterization record.

   o  Expected Endpoint Attribute Value Guidance: The expected values of
      the endpoint attributes described in the Target Endpoint Attribute
      Guidance.

   o  Frequency Guidance: Specifies when endpoint attributes are to be
      evaluated.

   o  Method Guidance: Indicates how endpoint attributes are to be
      collected.

6.6.3.  Classification Guidance

   A SACM Component carrying out the Target Endpoint Classification Task
   may need guidance on how to classify an endpoint.  Specifically, how
   to associate endpoint classes with a specific target endpoint
   characterization record.  Target Endpoint Classes function as
   guidance for collection, evaluation, remediation and security posture
   assessment in general.  Classification Guidance is composed of Target
   Endpoint Attribute Guidance and Class Guidance.

   o  Target Endpoint Attribute Guidance: Set of target endpoint
      attributes that are supposed to be used to identify the endpoint
      characterization record.

   o  Class Guidance: A list of target endpoint classes that are to be
      associated with the identified target endpoint characterization
      record.

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


6.6.4.  Storage Guidance

   An SACM Component typically needs guidance to govern what information
   it should store and where.  Storage Guidance provides instructions
   for a SACM Component that specifies which security automation
   information should be stored, for how long, and on which endpoint.
   Storage Guidance is composed of Target Endpoint Attribute Guidance,
   Expected Security Automation Information Guidance, and Retention
   Guidance.

   o  Target Endpoint Attribute Guidance: Set of target endpoint
      attributes that are supposed to be used to identify the endpoint
      where the security automation information is to be stored.

   o  Expected Security Automation Information Guidance: The security
      automation information that is expected to be stored (guidance,
      collected posture attributes, results, etc.).

   o  Retention Guidance: Specifies how long the security automation
      information should be stored.

6.6.5.  Evaluation Results

   Evaluation Results are the output of comparing the actual state of an
   endpoint against the expected state of an endpoint.  In addition to
   the actual results of the comparison, Evaluation Results should
   include the Evaluation Guidance and actual target endpoint attributes
   values used to perform the evaluation.

   relationships that will be implemented by data models and transported

8.  Acknowledgements

   Many of the specifications in this document have been developed in a
   public-private partnership with vendors and end-users.  The hard work
   of the SCAP community is appreciated in advancing these efforts to
   their current level of adoption.

   Over the course of developing the initial draft, Brant Cheikes, Matt
   Hansbury, Daniel Haynes, Scott Pope, Charles Schmidt, and Steve
   Venema have contributed text to many sections of this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies an initial set of Information Elements for
   SACM in Section 7.  An Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
   registry will be created and populated with the Information Elements
   in Section 7.  New assignments for SACM Information Elements will be
   administered by IANA through Expert Review [RFC2434].  The designated
   experts MUST check the requested Information Elements for
   completeness and accuracy of the submission with respect to the
   template and requirements expressed in Section 3.3 and Section 3.1.
   Requests for Information Elements that duplicate the functionality of
   existing Information Elements SHOULD be declined.  The smallest
   available Information Element identifier SHOULD be assigned to a new
   Information Element.  The definition of new Information Elements MUST
   be published using a well-established and persistent publication
   medium.

10.  Security Considerations

   Posture Assessments need to be performed in a safe and secure manner.
   In that regard, there are multiple aspects of security that apply to
   the communications between components as well as the capabilities
   themselves.  This information model only contains an initial listing
   of items that need to be considered with respect to security and will
   need to be augmented as the model continues to be developed.

   Security considerations include:

   Authentication:  Every SACM Component and asset needs to be able to
           identify itself and verify the identity of other SACM
           Components and assets.

   Confidentiality:  Communications between SACM Components need to be
           protected from eavesdropping or unauthorized collection.
           Some communications between SACM Components and assets may
           need to be protected as well.

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   Integrity:  The information exchanged between SACM Components needs
           to be protected from modification.  Some exchanges between
           assets and SACM Components will also have this requirement.

   Restricted Access:  Access to the information collected, evaluated,
           reported, and stored should only be viewable and consumable
           to authenticated and authorized entities.

   Considerations with respect to the operational aspects of collection,
   evaluation, and storage security automation information can be found
   in Section 11.

   Considerations concerning the privacy of security automation
   information can be found in Section 12.

11.  Operational Considerations

   The following sections outline a series of operational considerations
   for SACM deployments within an organization.  This section may be
   expanded to include other considerations as the WG gains additional
   operational experience with SACM deployments and extending the
   information model.

11.1.  Endpoint Designation

   In order to successfully carry out endpoint posture assessment, it is
   necessary to be able to identify the endpoints on a network and track
   the changes to them over time.  Specifically, enabling SACM
   Components to:

   o  Tell whether two endpoint attribute assertions concern the same
      endpoint

   o  Respond to compliance measurements, for example by reporting,
      remediating, and quarantining (SACM does not specify these
      responses, but SACM exists to enable them).

   Ideally, every endpoint would be identified by a unique identifier
   present on the endpoint, but, this is complicated due to different
   factors such as the variety of endpoints on a network, the ability of
   tools to reliably access such an identifer, and the ability of tools
   to correlate disparate identifiers.  As a result, it is necessary for
   an endpoint to be identified by a set of attributes that uniquely
   identify it on a network.  The set of attributes that uniquely
   identify an endpoint on a network will likely vary by organization;
   however, there are a number of properties to consider when selecting
   identifying attributes as some are better suited for identification
   purposes than others.

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   Multiplicity:  Is the attribute typically associated with a single
           endpoint or with multiple endpoints?  If the attribute is
           associated with a single endpoint, it is better for
           identifying an endpoint on a network.

   Persistence:  How likely is the attribute to change?  Does it never
           change?  Does it only change when the endpoint is
           reprovisioned?  Does it only change due to an event?  Does it
           change on an ad-hoc and often unpredictable basis?  Does it
           constantly change?  The less likely it is for an attribute to
           change over time, the better it is for identifying an
           endpoint on a network.

   Immutability:  How difficult is it to change the attribute?  Is the
           attribute hardware rooted and never changes?  Can the
           attribute be changed by a user/process with the appropriate
           access?  Can the attribute be changed without controlled
           access.  The less likely an attribute is to change over time,
           the better chance it will be usable to identify an endpoint
           over time.

   Verifiable:  Can the attribute be corroborated?  Can the attribute be
           externally verified with source authentication?  Can the
           attribute be externally verified without source
           authentication?  Is it impossible to externally verify the
           attribute.  Attributes that can be externally verified are
           more likely to be accurate and are better for identifying
           endpoints on a network.

   With that said, requiring SACM Components and end users to constantly
   refer to a set of attributes to identify an endpoint, is particularly
   burdensome.  As a result, SACM supports the concept of a target
   endpoint label which associates an identifier (unique to a SACM
   domain) with the set of attributes used by an organization to
   identify endpoints on a network.  Once defined for an endpoint, the
   target endpoint label can be used in place of the set of identifying
   attributes.

11.2.  Timestamp Accuracy

   An organization will likely have different collectors deployed across
   the network that will be configured to collect posture attributes on
   varying frequencies (periodic, ad-hoc, event-driven, on endpoint, off
   endpoint, etc.).  Some collectors will detect changes as soon as they
   occur whereas others will detect them at a later point during a
   periodic scan or when an event has triggered the collection of
   posture attributes.  Furthermore, some changes will be detected on
   the endpoint and others will be observed off of the endpoint.  As a



Waltermire, et al.        Expires March 5, 2017                [Page 53]

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   result of these differences, the accuracy of the timestamp associated
   with the collected information will vary.  For example, if a
   collector is only running once every 12 hours, the change probably
   happened at some point in time prior to the scan and the timestamp is
   likely not accurate.  Due to this, it is important for system
   administrators to determine if the accuracy of a timestamp is good
   enough for their intended purposes.

12.  Privacy Considerations

   In the IETF, there are privacy concerns with respect to endpoint
   identity and monitoring.  This is especially true when the activity
   on an endpoint can be linked to a particular person.  For example, by
   correlating endpoint attributes such as usernames, certificates, etc.
   with browser activity, it may be possible to gain insight in to user
   behavior and trends beyond what is required to carry out endpoint
   posture assessments.  In the hands of the wrong person, this
   information could be used to negatively influence a user's behavior
   or to plan attacks against the organization's infrastructure.

   As a result, SACM data models should incorporate a mechanism by which
   an organization can designate which endpoint attributes are
   considered sensitive with respect to privacy.  This will allow SACM
   Components to handle endpoint attributes in a manner consistent with
   the organization's privacy policies.  Furthermore, organization's
   should put the proper mechanism in place to ensure endpoint
   attributes are protected when transmitted, stored, and accessed to
   ensure only authorized parties are granted access.

   It should also be noted that some of this is often mitigated by
   organizational policies that require a user of an organization's
   network to consent to some level of monitoring in return for access
   to the network and other resources.  The information that is
   monitored and collected will vary by organization and further
   highlights the need for a mechanism by which an organization can
   specify what constitutes privacy sensitive information for them.

Appendix A.  Change Log

A.1.  Changes in Revision 01

   Added some proposed normative text.

   For provenance:

      Added a class "Method"

      Added the produced-using relationship between an AVP and a method

      Added the produced-by relationship between a Guidance and a SACM
      Component

      Added the hosted-by relationship between a SACM Component and an
      Endpoint

   asserted-by and summarized-by have been renamed to produced-by.

   "User" is now "Account".  If a user has different credentials, SACM
   cannot know that they belong to the same user.  But, per Kim W, many
   organizations do have accounts that associate credentials.

   The multiplicity of the based-on relationships has been corrected.

   More relationships now have labels, per UML convention.

   The diagram no longer has causal arrow.  They had become redundant
   and were nonstandard and clutter.

   Renamed "credential" to "identity", following industry usage.  A
   credential includes proof, such as a key or password.  A username or
   a distinguished name is called an "identity".

   Removed Session, because an endpoint's network activity is not SACM's
   initial focus

   Removed Authorization, for the same reason

   Added many-to-many relationship between Hardware Component and
   Endpoint, for clarity

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   Added many-to-many relationship between Software Component and
   Endpoint, for clarity

   Added "contains" relationship between Network Interface and Network
   Interface

   Removed relationship between Network Interface and Account.  The
   endpoint knows the identity it used to gain network access.  The PDP
   also knows that.  But they probably do not know the account.

   Added relationship between Network Interface and Identity.  The
   endpoint and the PDP will typically know the identity.

   Made identity-to-account a many-to-one relationship.

A.2.  Changes in Revision 02

   Added Section Identifying Attributes.

   Split the figure into Figure Model of Endpoint and Figure Information
   Elements.

   Added Figure Information Elements Take 2, proposing a triple-store
   model.

   Some editorial cleanup

A.3.  Changes in Revision 03

   Moved Appendix A.1, Appendix A.2, and Mapping to SACM Use Cases into
   the Appendix.  Added a reference to it in Section 1

   Added the Section 3.3 section.  Provided notes for the type of
   information we need to add in this section.

   Added the Section 6 section.  Moved sections on Endpoint, Hardware
   Component, Software Component, Hardware Instance, and Software
   Instance there.  Provided notes for the type of information we need
   to add in this section.

   Removed the Provenance of Information Section.  SACM is not going to
   solve provenance rather give organizations enough information to
   figure it out.

   Updated references to the Endpoint Security Posture Assessment:
   Enterprise Use Cases document to reflect that it was published as an
   RFC.

Internet-Draft           SACM Information Model           September 2016


   Fixed the formatting of a few figures.

   Included references to [RFC3580] where RADIUS is mentioned.

A.4.  Changes in Revision 04

   Integrated the IPFIX [RFC7012] syntax into Section 3.3.

   Converted many of the existing SACM Information Elements to the IPFIX
   syntax.

   Included existing IPFIX Information Elements and datatypes that could
   likely be reused for SACM in Section 7 and Section 3.3 respectively.

   Removed the sections related to reports as described in
   https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/
   issues/30.

   Cleaned up other text throughout the document.

A.5.  Changes in Revision 05

   Merged proposed changes from the I-D IM into the WG IM
   (https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/
   issues/41).

   Fixed some formatting warnings.

   Removed a duplicate IE and added a few IE datatypes that were
   missing.

A.6.  Changes in Revision 06

   Clarified that the SACM statement and content-element subjects are
   conceptual and that they do not need to be explicitly defined in a
   data model as long as the necessary information is provided.

   Updated the IPFIX syntax used to define Information Elements.  There
   are still a couple of open issues that need to be resolved.

   Updated some of the Information Elements contained in Section 7 to
   use the revised IPFIX syntax.  The rest of the Information Elements
   will be converted in a later revision.

   Performed various clean-up and refactoring in Sections 6 and 7.
   Still need to go through Section 8.

   Removed appendices that were not referenced in the body of the draft.
   The text from them is still available in previous revisions of this
   document if needed.
