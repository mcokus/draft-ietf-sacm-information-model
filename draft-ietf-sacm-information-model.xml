        <abstract>
            <t>This document defines the Information Elements that are necessary for the transportation of endpoint information 
                between Secure Automation and Continuous
                Monitoring (SACM) components, as well as tasks carried out on the endpoint information by SACM components. The primary purpose of the 
            SACM Information Model is to ensure 
            the interoperable exchange of security posture information 
             by defining the
            structure and metadata used to exchange the posture information represented by platform and/or vendor specific collection data models. The Information Elements and corresponding types are maintained 
            as the IANA "SACM Information Elements" registry.</t>

          <t>The SACM Information Model (IM) serves multiple purposes:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>to ensure interoperable exchange of security posture information which is represented by different data models,</t>
              <t>to provide a standardized set of Information Elements - the SACM Vocabulary - 
                to enable the exchange of content vital to automated security posture assessment, 
                and</t>
              <t>to enable secure information sharing in a scalable and extensible fashion in 
                order to support the tasks conducted by SACM components.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          
          <t>A complete set of requirements imposed on the IM can be
            found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-requirements"/>. The 
            SACM IM is intended to support a standardized data
            exchange mechanism between SACM components 
            (data in motion).</t>

          <t>The information model expresses, for example, target endpoint (TE) attributes, guidance, 
              and evaluation results metadata describing the collected posture data. The corresponding Information Elements are consumed and produced 
            by SACM components as they carry out tasks.</t>
          
          <t>The primary tasks that this information model supports (on data, control, and management 
            plane) are:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>TE Discovery</t>
              <t>TE Characterization</t>
              <t>TE Classification</t>
              <t>Collection</t>
              <t>Evaluation</t>
              <t>Information Sharing</t>
              <t>SACM Component Discovery</t>
              <t>SACM Component Authentication</t>
              <t>SACM Component Authorization</t>
              <t>SACM Component Registration</t>
            </list>
          </t>
           <t>These tasks are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-sacm-terminology"/>.</t>

                Elements (IEs) is based on a customized version of  
                the IPFIX information model syntax. 
                It should be noted that while examples

          <t>The IEs defined in this document comprise the building blocks by which all SACM 
            content is composed. They are consumed and provided by SACM components on the data 
            plane. Every Information Element has a unique label: its name. Every IE 
            defined by the SACM IM is registered as a type at the IANA registry. The Integer 
            Index of the IANA SMI number tables can be used by SACM data models.</t>

                anchor="naming-convention">

                        <t>Names SHOULD be descriptive</t>
                        <t>Names MUST be unique within the SACM registry. Enterprise-specific names 
                            SHOULD be prefixed with a Private Enterprise Number <xref target="PEN"/>.</t>
                        <t>Names MUST start with lowercase letters unless it begins with a Private 
                            Enterprise Number</t>

          <section title="Extensibility of Information Elements">
              
            <t>A SACM data model based on this information model MAY include additional information 
              elements that are not defined here. The labels of additional Information Elements 
              included in different SACM data models MUST NOT conflict with the labels of the 
              Information Elements defined by this information model, and the names of additional 
              Information Elements MUST NOT conflict with each other or across multiple data models. 
              In order to avoid naming conflicts, the labels of additional IEs SHOULD be prefixed 
              to avoid collisions across extensions. The prefix MUST include an organizational 
              identifier and therefore, for example, MAY be an IANA enterprise number, a (partial) 
              name space URI, or an organization name abbreviation.

        <section title="Structure of Information Elements" anchor="structure-of-information-elements">
          <t>There are two basic types of IEs:
            <list style="symbols">
                <t>Attributes: are "atomic" information elements with a unique name and a simple value. Attributes can be components of Subjects.</t>
                <t>Subjects: are composite information elements with a unique name and are composed of attributes and/or other subjects. Every IE that is part of a subject can have a quantity associated with it (0..1, 0..*, etc.). The contents of a subject can be ordered or unordered.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
                    
                   <t>Subjects can be nested and the SACM IM allows for circular or
                    recursive nesting.  The association of IEs via nesting results in a
                    tree-like structure wherein subjects compose the root and
                    intermediary nodes and attributes the leaves of the tree.  This
                    semantic structure does not impose a specific structure on SACM data
                    models regarding data in motion or data repository schemata for data
                    at rest.</t>

                             status. The process for moving 
                             Information Elements to the 
                             "deprecated" status is TBD.
   
    description (required): Describes the meaning of the 
                            Information Element, how it is 
                            derived, conditions for its use, 
                            etc.

                    Categories are special IEs which represent a choice among multiple IEs via just one name.       
                    A prominent example of a category is network-address.  Network-
                    address is a category that every kind of network address is
                    associated with, e.g. mac-address, ipv4-address, ipv6-address, or
                    typed-network-address.  If a subject includes network-address as one
                    of its components, any of the category members are valid to be used
                    in its place.</t>
                
                <t>Another prominent example is EndpointIdentifier.  Some IEs can be
                    used to identify (and over time re-recognize) target endpoints -
                    those are associated with the category endpoint-identifier.

            <t>The SACM IM provides two conceptual top-level subjects that are used
            to ensure a homogeneous structure for SACM content and its associated
            metadata: SACM statements and SACM content elements.  Every set of
            IEs that is provided by a SACM component must provide the information
            contained in these two subjects although it is up to the implementer
            whether or not the subjects are explicitly defined in a data model.</t>
            
            <t>In general, every piece of information that enables security posture
            assessment or further enriches the quality of the assessment process
            can be associated with metadata.  In the SACM IM, metadata is
            represented by special, predefined subjects and is bundled with other attributes
            or subjects to provide additional information about them.  The IM
            explicitly defines two kinds of metadata: sacmMetadata, focusing on the data origin (the SACM component that
            provides the information to the SACM domain), and contentMetadata, focusing on the data source (the target endpoint that is
            assessed).</t>
            
            <t>Metadata can also include relationships that refer to other
            associated IEs (or SACM content in general) by using referencing
            labels that have to be included in the metadata of the associated IE.</t>
            
            <t>Lastly, event subjects provide a structure to represent the change of IE
            values that was detected by a collection task at a specific point of
            time.</t>

                <t>Every piece of information that is provided by a SACM component is always associated 
                    with a set of metadata, for example, the timestamp at which this set of information 
                    was produced (e.g. by a collection task) or what target endpoint this set of 
                    information is about (e.g. the data-source or a target endpoint identifier, respectively). 
                    The subject that associates content IE with content-metadata IE is called a 
                    content-element. Content metadata can also include relationships that express associations

                anchor="sacm-statements">
                <t>One or more SACM content elements are bundled in a SACM statement. In contrast to 
                    content-metadata, statement-metadata focuses on the providing SACM component instead of the 
                    target endpoint that the content is about. The only content-specific metadata included in 
                    the SACM statement is the content-type IE. Therefore, multiple content-elements that share 
                    the same statement metadata and are of the same content-type can be included in a single 
                    SACM statement. A SACM statement functions similar to an envelope or a header. Its purpose 
                    is to enable the tracking of the origin of data inside a SACM domain and more importantly 
                    to enable the mitigation of conflicting information that may originate from different SACM 
                    components. How a consuming SACM component actually deals with conflicting information is 
                    out-of-scope of the SACM IM. Semantically, the term statement implies that the SACM content 
                    provided by a SACM component might not be correct in every context, but rather is the result 
                    of a best-effort to produce correct information.</t>

                    included in a corresponding content-metadata subject. The

                    SACM IM does not enforce a SACM domain to use unique identifiers as 
                    references. Therefore, there are at least two

                    <t>The notation for defining a SACM structured datatype is based on regular 
                        expressions, which are composed of the keywords "list" or "orderedList"
                        and an Information Element expression.  IE expressions use some of the regular 
                        expression syntax and operators, but the terms in the expression are 
                        the names of defined Information Elements instead of character classes. The 
                        syntax for defining list and orderedList datatypes is described below, using 
                        BNF:</t>

                <t>As defined in <xref target="RFC4949"/>, an asset is a system resource that 
                    is (a) required to be protected by an information system's security policy, 
                    (b) intended to be protected by a countermeasure, or (c) required for a 
                    system's mission.</t>  
                <t>In the scope of SACM, an asset can be composed of other assets. Examples of 
                   Assets include: Endpoints, Software, Guidance, or Identity. Furthermore, an 
                   asset is not necessarily owned by an organization.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Endpoint">
                <t>From <xref target="RFC5209"/>, an endpoint is any computing device that can 
                    be connected to a network. Such devices normally are associated with a 
                    particular link layer address before joining the network and potentially 
                    an IP address once on the network. This includes: laptops, desktops, 
                    servers, cell phones, or any device that may have an IP address.</t>
               <t>To further clarify, an endpoint is any physical or virtual device that 
                   may have a network address. Note that, network infrastructure devices 
                   (e.g. switches, routers, firewalls), which fit the definition, are also 
                   considered to be endpoints within this document.</t> 
                <t>Physical endpoints are always composites that are composed of hardware 
                   components and software components. Virtual endpoints are composed entirely 
                   of software components and rely on software components that provide 
                   functions equivalent to hardware components.</t>
                <t>The SACM architecture differentiates two essential categories of endpoints: 
                    Endpoints whose security posture is intended to be assessed (target endpoints) 
                    and endpoints that are specifically excluded from endpoint posture 
                    assessment (excluded endpoints).</t>

            <section title="Hardware Component">
                <t>Hardware components are the distinguishable physical components that compose an 
                    endpoint. The composition of an endpoint can be changed over time by adding 
                    or removing hardware components. In essence, every physical endpoint is 
                    potentially a composite of multiple hardware components, typically resulting 
                    in a hierarchical composition of hardware components. The composition of hardware 
                    components is based on interconnects provided by specific hardware types (e.g. 
                    mainboard is a hardware type that provides local busses as an interconnect). In 
                    general, a hardware component can be distinguished by its serial number.</t>
                <t>Examples of a hardware components include: motherboards, network interfaces, graphics

                <t>It should be noted that this includes both benign and harmful software packages. Examples

                    a low-frequency and tend to be sporadic. A prominent example of guidance are target endpoint profiles,but 
                    guidance can have many forms, including:

            <section title="Endpoint Designation" anchor="endpoint-designation">
                <t>In order to successfully carry out endpoint posture assessment, it is 
                   necessary to be able to identify the endpoints on a network and track the 
                   changes to them over time. Specifically, enabling SACM Components to:
                    <list style="symbols">
                        <t>Tell whether two endpoint attribute assertions concern the same 
                           endpoint</t>
                        <t>Respond to compliance measurements, for example by reporting, 
                           remediating, and quarantining (SACM does not specify these responses,
                            but SACM exists to enable them).</t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>Ideally, every endpoint would be identified by a unique identifier present on 
                   the endpoint, but, this is complicated due to different factors such as the 
                   variety of endpoints on a network, the ability of tools to reliably access such 
                   an identifer, and the ability of tools to correlate disparate identifiers. As a 
                   result, it is necessary for an endpoint to be identified by a set of attributes 
                   that uniquely identify it on a network. The set of attributes that uniquely 
                   identify an endpoint on a network will likely vary by organization; however, there are 
                   a number of properties to consider when selecting identifying attributes as some 
                   are better suited for identification purposes than others.
                    <list style="hanging" hangIndent="8">
                        <t hangText="Multiplicity:">Is the attribute typically associated with a single endpoint 
                           or with multiple endpoints? If the attribute is associated with a single 
                           endpoint, it is better for identifying an endpoint on a network.</t>
                        <t hangText="Persistence:">How likely is the attribute to change? Does it never change? 
                            Does it only change when the endpoint is reprovisioned? Does it only change 
                            due to an event? Does it change on an ad-hoc and often unpredictable basis? 
                            Does it constantly change? The less likely it is for an attribute to change 
                            over time, the better it is for identifying an endpoint on a network.</t>
                        <t hangText="Immutability:">How difficult is it to change the attribute? Is the attribute
                            hardware rooted and never changes? Can the attribute be changed by a 
                            user/process with the appropriate access? Can the attribute be changed 
                            without controlled access. The less likely an attribute is to change over 
                            time, the better chance it will be usable to identify an endpoint over time.</t> 
                        <t hangText="Verifiable:">Can the attribute be corroborated? Can the attribute be externally
                            verified with source authentication? Can the attribute be externally verified 
                            without source authentication? Is it impossible to externally verify the 
                            attribute. Attributes that can be externally verified are more likely to be 
                            accurate and are better for identifying endpoints on a network.
                        </t>
                    </list>
                </t>
                <t>With that said, requiring SACM Components and end users to constantly refer to a set 
                    of attributes to identify an endpoint, is particularly burdensome. As a result, SACM 
                    supports the concept of a target endpoint label which associates an identifier (unique
                    to a SACM domain) with the set of attributes used by an organization to identify 
                    endpoints on a network. Once defined for an endpoint, the target endpoint label can be
                    used in place of the set of identifying attributes.</t>
            </section>
            <section title="Timestamp Accuracy" anchor="timestamp-accuracy">
                <t>An organization will likely have different collectors deployed across the network that 
                   will be configured to collect posture attributes on varying frequencies (periodic, ad-hoc, 
                   event-driven, on endpoint, off endpoint, etc.). Some collectors will detect changes as soon 
                   as they occur whereas others will detect them at a later point during a periodic scan or 
                   when an event has triggered the collection of posture attributes. Furthermore, some changes 
                   will be detected on the endpoint and others will be observed off of the endpoint. As a result
                   of these differences, the accuracy of the timestamp associated with the collected information 
                   will vary. For example, if a collector is only running once every 12 hours, the change probably 
                   happened at some point in time prior to the scan and the timestamp is likely not accurate. Due
                   to this, it is important for system administrators to determine if the accuracy of a timestamp
                   is good enough for their intended purposes.

        </section>
        
        <section title="Privacy Considerations" anchor="privacy-considerations">
            <t>In the IETF, there are privacy concerns with respect to endpoint 
               identity and monitoring. This is especially true when the
               activity on an endpoint can be linked to a particular person. For
               example, by correlating endpoint attributes such as usernames,
               certificates, etc. with browser activity, it may be possible to
               gain insight in to user behavior and trends beyond what is
               required to carry out endpoint posture assessments. In the hands
               of the wrong person, this information could be used to negatively
               influence a user's behavior or to plan attacks against the 
               organization's infrastructure.</t> 
            <t>As a result, SACM data models should incorporate a mechanism by
               which an organization can designate which endpoint attributes are
               considered sensitive with respect to privacy. This will allow
               SACM Components to handle endpoint attributes in a manner
               consistent with the organization's privacy policies. Furthermore, 
               organization's should put the proper mechanism in place to ensure
               endpoint attributes are protected when transmitted, stored, and
               accessed to ensure only authorized parties are granted access.</t>
           <t>It should also be noted that some of this is often mitigated by
               organizational policies that require a user of an organization's
               network to consent to some level of monitoring in return for
               access to the network and other resources. The information that
               is monitored and collected will vary by organization and further
               highlights the need for a mechanism by which an organization can
               specify what constitutes privacy sensitive information for them.</t>

            <section title="Changes in Revision 03">
                <t>Moved <xref target="changes-in-revision-01"/>, <xref target="changes-in-revision-02"/>, and Mapping to SACM Use Cases into the Appendix.  Added a reference to it in <xref target="INTRO"/></t>
                <t>Added the <xref target="structure-of-information-elements"/> section.  Provided notes for the type of information we need to add in this section.</t>
                <t>Added the <xref target="information-model-assets"/> section. Moved sections on Endpoint, Hardware Component, Software Component, Hardware Instance, and Software Instance there. Provided notes for the type of information we need to add in this section.</t>
                <t>Removed the Provenance of Information Section.  SACM is not going to solve provenance rather give organizations enough information to figure it out.</t>
                <t>Updated references to the Endpoint Security Posture Assessment: Enterprise Use Cases document to reflect that it was published as an RFC.</t>
                <t>Fixed the formatting of a few figures.</t>

            <section title="Changes in Revision 04">
              <t>Integrated the IPFIX <xref target="RFC7012"/> syntax
                into <xref target="structure-of-information-elements"/>.</t>
              <t>Converted many of the existing SACM Information
                Elements to the IPFIX syntax.</t>
              <t>Included existing IPFIX Information Elements and
                datatypes that could likely be reused for SACM in <xref
                  target="information-model-elements"/> and <xref
                    target="structure-of-information-elements"/>
                respectively.</t>
              <t>Removed the sections related to reports as described
                in https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/issues/30.</t>

                <t>Merged proposed changes from the I-D IM into 
                    the WG IM (https://github.com/sacmwg/draft-ietf-sacm-information-model/issues/41).</t>
                <t>Fixed some formatting warnings.</t>
                <t>Removed a duplicate IE and added a few IE datatypes
                    that were missing.</t>
            </section>
            
            <section title="Changes in Revision 06">
                <t>Clarified that the SACM statement and content-element subjects are conceptual
                    and that they do not need to be explicitly defined in a data model as long as
                    the necessary information is provided.</t>
                <t>Updated the IPFIX syntax used to define Information Elements. There are still
                   a couple of open issues that need to be resolved.</t>
                <t>Updated some of the Information Elements contained in Section 7 to use the revised 
                    IPFIX syntax. The rest of the Information Elements will be converted in a later
                    revision.</t>
                <t>Performed various clean-up and refactoring in Sections 6 and 7. Still need to
                   go through Section 8.</t>
                <t>Removed appendices that were not referenced in the body of the draft. The text
                   from them is still available in previous revisions of this document if needed.</t>

            <section title="Changes in Revision 07">
                <t>Made various changes to the IPFIX syntax based on discussions at the IETF 96 Meeting.
                   Changes included the addition of a structure property to the IE specification template,
                   the creation of an enumeration datatype, and the
                   specification of an IE naming convention.</t>
                <t>Provided text to define Collection Guidance, Evaluation Guidance, Classification Guidance, 
                   Storage Guidance, and Evaluation Results.</t>
                <t>Included additional IEs related to software, configuration, and the vulnerability assessment
